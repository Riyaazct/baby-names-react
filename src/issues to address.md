when either of the gender buttons are selected, and a search is initiated, it returns all the names of both male and female when search bar is cleared instead of the names that were displayed by the button selected.

this creates duplicates of the names when there is a name in the favourites section and the names list is updated to display all the names again once the search bar is cleared
